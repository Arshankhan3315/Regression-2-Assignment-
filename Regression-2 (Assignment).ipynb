    "\n",
    "# Loss of Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization methods can shrink coefficients towards zero, making the model more robust, but at the cost of interpretability. In some situations, it might be crucial to have a model that is easily interpretable, especially when the goal is to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable.\n",
    "# Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The performance of regularized models is sensitive to the choice of the regularization parameter (λ). Determining the optimal value for λ can be challenging, and the model's performance may be suboptimal if the parameter is not chosen carefully. This sensitivity requires additional effort in hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "# Not Ideal for Small Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularized models may not perform well on small datasets. When the number of observations is limited, regularization might not have sufficient data to effectively estimate the coefficients and determine the impact of the regularization term.\n",
    "# Data Standardization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization assumes that all features are on the same scale. If features have different scales, regularization may unfairly penalize larger-scale features. Proper data standardization (scaling) is required before applying regularization.\n",
    "# Loss of Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some cases, the regularization term might lead to the exclusion of potentially valuable information. For instance, if all features are important and should contribute to the model, the sparsity induced by Lasso might result in the exclusion of relevant predictors.\n",
    "# Presence of Categorical Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization techniques may not handle categorical variables well. While there are ways to encode categorical variables for use in regularized models, the process is not always straightforward, and the choice of encoding can impact results.\n",
    "# Assumption of Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between features and the target variable. If the true relationship is highly nonlinear, these models may not capture the underlying patterns effectively.\n",
    "# Loss of Ridge Stability for Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While Ridge regression is designed to handle multicollinearity, it does so by distributing the impact of correlated features more evenly. In some cases, this might lead to a loss of stability in the Ridge estimates.\n",
